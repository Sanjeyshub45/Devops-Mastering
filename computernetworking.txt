Computer Networking 
--------------------

What is a Computer:
COMPUTER → Common Operating Machine Purposely Used for Technological and Educational Research.

What is a Computer Network:
A Computer Network is a group of interconnected computers that can communicate and share resources like files, printers, and internet connections.

What is the Internet:
The Internet is a global collection of interconnected computer networks.

First Website (World Wide Web):
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html

Internet Society (ISOC):
It maintains internet standards, protocols, and governance.
Website → https://www.internetsociety.org

Client-Server Architecture:
- The client sends a request (example: typing www.google.com).
- The server processes the request and sends a response back to the client.

How the Internet is Connected:
- Internet connections are not in the cloud but through undersea cables connecting continents.

Protocols (Rules of Communication):
Protocols are a set of rules defined by the Internet Society for communication between devices.

TCP → Transmission Control Protocol → Ensures reliable data delivery (no corruption or loss).
UDP → User Datagram Protocol → Fast but does not guarantee delivery.
HTTP → HyperText Transfer Protocol → Used by web browsers for websites (Port 80).
HTTPS → HTTP Secure → Secure version of HTTP using encryption (Port 443).
FTP → File Transfer Protocol → Used to transfer files between computers (Port 21).
SMTP → Simple Mail Transfer Protocol → Used to send emails (Port 25).

Connectivity of Computers:
1. Guided Media (Wired Communication)
   - Data travels through physical media.
   - Examples: Twisted Pair Cable, Coaxial Cable, Optical Fiber Cable.

2. Unguided Media (Wireless Communication)
   - Data travels through air.
   - Examples: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G/4G/5G.

Types of Networks:
LAN (Local Area Network) → Small area like office or home.
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) → City-level network.
WAN (Wide Area Network) → Country or global level network.

Technologies used:
SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) → Allows data to travel long distances.
Frame Relay → Connects local area networks to wide area networks.

Networking Devices:
Modem → Converts digital signals to analog and vice versa.
Router → Routes data packets based on IP address.
Switch → Connects multiple devices within a LAN and forwards data efficiently.
Hub → Broadcasts data to all devices (less efficient).
Access Point → Allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network (Wi-Fi).

Additional Key Points:
IP Address → Unique number assigned to each device on a network.
DNS (Domain Name System) → Converts website names into IP addresses.
MAC Address → Unique hardware address of a network device.
Bandwidth → Amount of data transmitted per second.
Latency → Time delay in data transfer between source and destination.

Topologies:

Bus Topology:

Computers are connected in series using one main backbone wire.
If that wire is broken, the entire network will fail.

Ring Topology:

Computers are connected in a circular ring form.
If one system fails, the whole network is affected.
It can cause unnecessary data circulation.

Star Topology:

All computers are connected to one central device like a hub or switch.
If the central device fails, the whole network stops.
Easy to manage but centralization is a limitation.

Tree Topology:

It is a combination of bus and star topologies.
Used in large networks like universities or offices.
Scalable but complex to maintain.

Mesh Topology:

Every computer is connected to every other computer.
Very reliable but expensive due to many wires.
Has scalability issues.

Structure of Network:

OSI Model (7 Layers):
This model defines how two computers communicate through the network.

Application Layer – Where users interact using apps like browsers, WhatsApp.

Presentation Layer – Converts data formats, handles encryption and compression.

Session Layer – Manages connection sessions between devices.

Transport Layer – Ensures reliable delivery using TCP or UDP.

Network Layer – Handles routing and IP addressing.

Data Link Layer – Works with MAC addresses and data frames.

Physical Layer – Deals with cables, signals, and physical transmission.

Note: A collection of servers is called a Data Center.

TCP/IP Model:

It is a practical model used for internet communication.

Application Layer
Transport Layer
Network Layer
Data Link Layer
Physical Layer

Protocols:

Web Protocols (TCP/IP based):
HTTP – HyperText Transfer Protocol
HTTPS – Secure version of HTTP
FTP – File Transfer Protocol
SMTP – Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
POP3 – Post Office Protocol (for receiving emails)
DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
SSH – Secure Shell (remote access)
VNC – Virtual Network Computing (remote desktop)

Sockets and Ports:

Socket – Interface between processes and the internet.
Port – Identifies which process or application data should go to.
Ephemeral Ports – Temporary ports used by clients.

HTTP Methods:

GET – Request data from the server.
POST – Send data to the server.
PUT – Update or upload data to a specific location.
DELETE – Remove data from the server.

Status Codes:

100 Range – Informational responses.
200 Range – Successful responses (example: 200 OK).
300 Range – Redirection messages.
400 Range – Client errors (example: 404 Not Found).
500 Range – Server errors (example: 500 Internal Server Error).

Cookies:

Cookies are small text files stored in the client’s browser.
When a user visits a site for the first time, a cookie is stored. 
Next time the same site is visited, the cookie is sent in the request header.
This helps the server identify the returning user.
..
Mail Protocols:

POP – Post Office Protocol
IMAP – Internet Message Access Protocol

DNS and ICANN:

DNS – Domain Name System
ICANN – Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers

How DNS Works (Example: www.google.com
):

User types www.google.com in the browser. ->The computer checks local OS cache for the IP address.
->If not found, it goes to the ISP’s DNS server.

->If the ISP doesn’t have it, the request goes to the Root DNS server.

->The root server directs the query to the Top-Level Domain (like .com).

->The TLD server provides the IP address for google.com.

->The ISP then connects the user to Google’s actual server.

Transport Layer:

The Transport Layer defines where the data should go inside the computer after coming from the Network Layer.
It uses Multiplexing and Demultiplexing to handle multiple applications.

Multiplexing – Sending different messages from different applications through one communication medium.
Demultiplexing – Receiving multiple messages and delivering them to the correct applications.

This layer attaches port numbers to packets to identify source and destination applications.
It also controls congestion (network traffic), which is built into TCP.

Checksums – Used to check if the data is received correctly without errors.
Timers – Used to detect lost packets; if a timer expires, data is resent.

UDP (User Datagram Protocol):

UDP is a transport layer protocol.
Data may or may not reach the destination correctly.
Packets may get lost or come out of order.
It is a connectionless protocol and uses checksums for error detection.

UDP Packet contains: Source Port Number, Destination Port Number, Length of Datagram, Checksum, Data.

Use Cases: DNS lookups, Video conferencing, Online gaming, Real-time applications where speed is important

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):

TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented transport protocol.
It divides data into smaller segments with headers and checksums.
It maintains order and ensures all data reaches the destination.

Features: Connection oriented, Error control, Congestion control, Full duplex (two-way communication)

3-Way Handshake Process:

* SYN – Client requests a connection

* SYN-ACK – Server acknowledges

* ACK – Client confirms connection

Network Layer:

This layer is responsible for sending data across networks and choosing the best path for data to travel.
Routers work at this layer.

Routers have two types of tables:
Routing Table – Contains all available routes.
Forwarding Table – Contains the best route to send packets.

Control Plane – Builds and updates the routing table.

Types of Routing:
Static Routing – Manually set routes (time-consuming).
Dynamic Routing – Automatically updates as network changes. Uses Dijkstra’s Algorithm for best path.
