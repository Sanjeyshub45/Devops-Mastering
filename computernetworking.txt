Computer Networking Notes
---------------------------------

What is a Computer:
COMPUTER → Common Operating Machine Purposely Used for Technological and Educational Research.

What is a Computer Network:
A Computer Network is a group of interconnected computers that can communicate and share resources like files, printers, and internet connections.

What is the Internet:
The Internet is a global collection of interconnected computer networks.

First Website (World Wide Web):
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html

Internet Society (ISOC):
It maintains internet standards, protocols, and governance.
Website → https://www.internetsociety.org

Client-Server Architecture:
- The client sends a request (example: typing www.google.com).
- The server processes the request and sends a response back to the client.

How the Internet is Connected:
- Internet connections are not in the cloud but through undersea cables connecting continents.

Protocols (Rules of Communication):
Protocols are a set of rules defined by the Internet Society for communication between devices.

TCP → Transmission Control Protocol → Ensures reliable data delivery (no corruption or loss).
UDP → User Datagram Protocol → Fast but does not guarantee delivery.
HTTP → HyperText Transfer Protocol → Used by web browsers for websites (Port 80).
HTTPS → HTTP Secure → Secure version of HTTP using encryption (Port 443).
FTP → File Transfer Protocol → Used to transfer files between computers (Port 21).
SMTP → Simple Mail Transfer Protocol → Used to send emails (Port 25).

Connectivity of Computers:
1. Guided Media (Wired Communication)
   - Data travels through physical media.
   - Examples: Twisted Pair Cable, Coaxial Cable, Optical Fiber Cable.

2. Unguided Media (Wireless Communication)
   - Data travels through air.
   - Examples: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 3G/4G/5G.

Types of Networks:
LAN (Local Area Network) → Small area like office or home.
MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) → City-level network.
WAN (Wide Area Network) → Country or global level network.

Technologies used:
SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) → Allows data to travel long distances.
Frame Relay → Connects local area networks to wide area networks.

Networking Devices:
Modem → Converts digital signals to analog and vice versa.
Router → Routes data packets based on IP address.
Switch → Connects multiple devices within a LAN and forwards data efficiently.
Hub → Broadcasts data to all devices (less efficient).
Access Point → Allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network (Wi-Fi).

Additional Key Points:
IP Address → Unique number assigned to each device on a network.
DNS (Domain Name System) → Converts website names into IP addresses.
MAC Address → Unique hardware address of a network device.
Bandwidth → Amount of data transmitted per second.
Latency → Time delay in data transfer between source and destination.

Topologies:--
* Bus Topology -> Computers are connected in Series with one backbone wire.IF that wire is broken that will spoil the entire network.
